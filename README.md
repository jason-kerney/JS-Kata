## Purpose ##

### Problem Statement

I wanted a quick way to get started with a kata, particularly when introducing other developers to them. I found that the time taken to just get the initial setup up and running detracted from doing the kata.

### Solution

So this project allows for a quick setup of various test environment by providing multiple templates.
    

## How to use this project ##

JS-Kata is designed to be your template, not a template generator. The way you use it, is there is a branch for each supported test framework. You switch your branch and then delete the .git folder and start over.

**NOTE:** This readme will also change to give you information on how to run each test framework.

### Currently Supported

1. Mocha

### Future Support

1. Jasmine
2. Jest
    

## Useful Tool ##

The templates provided through this project are designed to utilizes [gittey](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gittey) to make things easier. Gittey is not required but useful.

Gittey is a command runner with understanding of git.

To install:

`npm i -g gittey`

### Useful commands

#### To run the tests

`gittey test`

This will run tests and commit the code if the tests pass

#### To commit code

`gittey commit`

This will commit code with prompts, including message.

#### To undo current work

`gittey undo`

This will reset the directory to the last commit

#### To checkout a different branch

`gittey checkout`

Lets you choose which branch to checkout via selection list.
